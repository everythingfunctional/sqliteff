SQLite for Fortran
========================

[![pipeline status](https://gitlab.com/everythingfunctional/sqliteff/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/everythingfunctional/sqliteff/commits/master)

A thin wrapper around the SQLite library. The `sqliteff_*` functions are
effectively identical to the `sqlite3_*` functions that would be called
from C, but with Fortran intrinsics and types. For more detailed information
you should consult the [SQLite documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html).
